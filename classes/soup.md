# Ruby classes

Write a program that asks a user for one ingredient and tells them as a response in which soup this ingredient is.

There are five soups in our restaurant:

- Tomato soup
- Potato soup
- Lentils soup
- Pumpkin soup
- Peas soup

Each soup has the ingredient in the name.

All soups have salt and pepper.
If the user enters salt or pepper, the program will respond with:

`All our soups have salt and pepper, give me another ingredient.`

If the user gives an ingredient that no soup has, the program will respond with:

`I am sorry, but we don't have a soup with this ingredient. Give me another ingredient.`

Solve this issue with a class and some methods.
