# Drops and rainbow

Write a Ruby program that counts raindrops from 1 to 100. For 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 it prints "rainbow!" instead in a similar way to this:

```ruby
1 drop
2 drops
3 drops
4 drops
5 drops
6 drops
7 drops
8 drops
9 drops
rainbow!
11 drops
12 drops
.
.
.
.
.
99 drops
rainbow!
```

## What you need to pay attention to:

1) 1 drop but drops for any other case :)

2) How can you do this efficiently?


## Some concepts that could help you:

- Arrays and ranges
- Loops
